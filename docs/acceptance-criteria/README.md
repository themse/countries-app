6. Deliver an interface that seamlessly adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal user experience across devices.
7. Enhance user interaction by incorporating hover and focus states for all interactive elements throughout the page.
8. Upload the project code to your GitHub repository.
    - Document how to execute the app locally
9. Implement unit testing for the project and ensure code coverage.
    - Document how to run the unit test and how the generate the coverage report in the README.md file.
